## 🧠 Technical Highlights

This project pushed the boundaries of what's possible with pure CSS:

- **CSS-Only Interactivity**: Used `:checked` pseudo-selectors and label associations to simulate JavaScript behavior
- **Advanced Layouts**: Mastered CSS Grid for complex page structures and Flexbox for component alignment
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Built responsive layouts that work seamlessly across all devices
- **Accessibility Focus**: Implemented semantic HTML with proper focus states and screen reader compatibility

The most challenging aspect was creating a functional shopping cart interface using only CSS—achieving this required creative problem-solving and deep understanding of CSS fundamentals.
