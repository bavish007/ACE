## 🧠 My Journey & Reflections
This project was a deep dive into the world of modern CSS and responsive web design. Starting from a blank canvas, I iterated through multiple design ideas before settling on a cyberpunk-inspired theme that felt both bold and user-friendly. The biggest challenge was achieving interactivity (like hover effects, focus states, and responsive layouts) purely with CSS—no JavaScript at all! I learned to leverage Flexbox and Grid for complex layouts, and used gradients and shadows to create depth and visual interest. Testing across devices taught me the value of mobile-first design. Overall, this experiment pushed my front-end skills and gave me a new appreciation for what's possible with just HTML and CSS.
