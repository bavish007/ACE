## 🧠 My Journey & Reflections
This project was my introduction to Bootstrap as a rapid UI development tool. I was amazed at how quickly I could build complex layouts and responsive components compared to writing raw CSS. The biggest challenge was balancing Bootstrap's default look with my own cyberpunk-inspired branding—custom CSS and utility overrides were key. I learned the value of prototyping, the power of Bootstrap's grid, and how to keep accessibility in mind even when using frameworks. This experiment gave me the confidence to use Bootstrap for future projects and taught me how to blend frameworks with personal design vision.
