# 🌐 NeoShop – Custom Node.js Server Experience

## 📖 Objective
This project is a fully custom Node.js HTTP server powering a modern, multi-page e-commerce demo for the fictional NeoShop brand. Built from scratch using only Node.js core modules, it was designed to master low-level HTTP handling, static asset serving, and elegant UI delivery—without any frameworks. The focus is on understanding server fundamentals, routing, and delivering a seamless, responsive user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Node.js** (core http, fs, path modules)
- **HTML5** (semantic markup)
- **CSS3** (dark mode, responsive design)
- **Vanilla JS** (minimal, only for server logic)

## 🧠 My Journey & Reflections
Creating NeoShop's custom server was a deep dive into the internals of Node.js and web protocols. I learned to handle routing, MIME types, and static assets without relying on frameworks. The biggest challenge was ensuring clean, maintainable code while supporting a rich UI and multiple routes. Seeing the server respond instantly to requests and serve a beautiful frontend was incredibly rewarding. This project gave me confidence in backend fundamentals and a new appreciation for the power of pure Node.js.
