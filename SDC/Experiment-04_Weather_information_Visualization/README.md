# 🌦️ Weathering You – Dynamic Weather Visualization

## 📖 Objective
This project is an interactive, visually rich weather dashboard that allows users to search for any city and view real-time weather data, 5-day forecasts, and dynamic weather visualizations. Built to master modern web APIs, data visualization, and responsive UI design, it targets skills in JavaScript, Bootstrap, Chart.js, and Leaflet.js, while focusing on user experience and accessibility.

## 🧠 My Journey & Reflections
This project was a deep dive into real-world data visualization and interactive UI design. Integrating multiple libraries—Bootstrap, Chart.js, and Leaflet—was both challenging and rewarding, especially when synchronizing data updates and animations. I learned how to handle asynchronous API calls, manage UI state, and create engaging visual feedback for users. The biggest breakthrough was making the weather experience feel alive with custom animations and map interactivity. This experiment gave me confidence in building modern, data-driven web apps from scratch.
