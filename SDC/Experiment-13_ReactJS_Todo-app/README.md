## 🧠 My Journey & Reflections
Building TaskFlow was a rewarding exercise in balancing functionality and user experience. Designing for both light and dark modes, and ensuring smooth task management, deepened my understanding of React's component model. Debugging state updates and perfecting the UI flow taught me the value of attention to detail. This project has made me more confident in building polished, user-friendly web apps.
